        <p>Introducing Chimère Pay</p>
        <p>A P2P Decentralized Stablecoin Payment System</p>
        <p>Think: Google Pay for Stablecoin Payments</p>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="ws-text__heading">
      <p>Our Goal</p>
      <p>We envision to onboard and retain atleast 20% of the Global Population to the Stablecoin Economy.</p>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="ws-text__heading">
      <p>Why Stablecoins?</p>
      <p>Fiat Currencies are centralized silos inhibiting Consumers to consume and Businesses to operate globally whereas Decentralized Cryptocurrencies are too volatile to be accepted as a reliable medium of exchange, thus making Stablecoins the only viable solution for global commerce.</p>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="ws-text__heading">
      <p>Why Us?</p>
      <p>The process of accessing and using Stablecoins via Decentralized Crypto Wallets is too complicated for regular consumers and businesses whereas Centralized Exchanges compromise on the user’s privacy, and ownership, and are not purposely built for payments.</p>
      <p>Thus, we are proposing a first of its kind P2P Stablecoin Payment Solution which will ensure a smooth User Experience for regular Consumers and Businesses while maintaining Decentralization.</p>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="ws-text__heading">
